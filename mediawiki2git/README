This script converts a mediawiki dump into git's fast-import format.
It is most suitable for history dumps generated by Special:Export page.

It is assumed that the input dump contains revisions in chronological order.

Example:
Create a repository with up to 1000 latest edits (max limit) to some wikipedia page:

  git init .
  URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Export&pages=Support+vector+machine&limit=1000&action=submit"
  curl -d "" "$URL" | mediawiki2git.py | git fast-import
  git reset --hard master

Here, curl -d tells it to make a POST request which is currently required for fetching history.
